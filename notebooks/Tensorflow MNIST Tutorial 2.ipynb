    "Welcome! In this lab, you'll learn how to perform image classification using convolutional neural networks. In particular, we will train and evaluate a simple feed-forward Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset for the task of handwritten digit classification. We will go through all the steps, including loading the data, building and training a model, making predictions and calculating the classification accuracy. We will use the [Tensorflow library](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) to build and train our model.\n",
